This is a site I built in a previous class for my girlfriends weavings that I cleaned up 
and added a couple js things to.  The home page has 2 jquery slide shows on different 
timers for a nice effect.  The about page is just a quick layout with a short bio.  
The gallery page features some non-jquery mouseover event handling that shows a full 
version of the picture to the right when hovering over a thumbnail.  The get-in-touch 
page handles blur events in the email and name inputs so the user is reminded to not 
leave the name field empty and to use an actual email address (had to include @ and a .).
